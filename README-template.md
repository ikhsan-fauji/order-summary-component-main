# Frontend Mentor - Order summary card solution

Hello my name is Ikhsan Fauji, and this is my solution to the [Order summary card challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/order-summary-component-QlPmajDUj). Really interesting to do this challence because it has amazing design with clear user experience. I have to build out this order summary card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible even if I don't have the detail informations of the design because I use free account to solve this challenge.
