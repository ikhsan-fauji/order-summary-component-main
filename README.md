# Frontend Mentor - Order summary card solution

Hello my name is Ikhsan Fauji, and this is my solution to the [Order summary card challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/order-summary-component-QlPmajDUj). Really interesting to do this challence because it has amazing design with clear user experience. I have to build out this order summary card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible even if I don't have the detail informations of the design because I use free account to solve this challenge.

## My process



### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Sass Style Preprocessor
- Mobile-first Workflow
- Accessibility Approach

### What I learned

In this challenge I keep in mind to setup the SASS style pre processor and create boz-shadow.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<article class="card">...</article>
```
```css
.card {
  box-shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1) 0px 10px 15px -3px, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05) 0px 4px 6px -2px;
}
```
```js
"scripts": {
  "sass": "sass ./assets/sass/index.scss ./assets/css/style.css"
}
```

### Continued development

The first thing I wana do is learn more deep about css so that I can styling my html more easier.
